# ETS Examples

This repository is a growing and living folder of example implementations and use cases of various aspects of the ETS Stack, including @ethereum-tag-service/sdk-core and @ethereum-tag-service/sdk-react-hooks packages.

These examples are intended to demonstrate key aspects of ETS as well as provide code you can copy for your own tagging projects.

Each example has it's own isolated StackBlitz project, so you can see the example in action and modify it if you wish.

- SDK Core
  - Simple contract read
  - Simple create tagging record (contract write)
